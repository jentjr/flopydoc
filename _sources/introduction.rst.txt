What is FloPy? 
==============

The FloPy package consists of a set of Python scripts to run MODFLOW, MT3D, SEAWAT and other MODFLOW-related groundwater programs. FloPy enables you to run all these programs with Python scripts. The FloPy project started in 2009 and has grown to a fairly complete set of scripts with a growing user base. FloPy3 was released in December 2014 with a few great enhancements that make FloPy3 backwards incompatible. The first significant change is that FloPy3 uses zero-based indexing everywhere, which means that all layers, rows, columns, and stress periods start numbering at zero. This change was made for consistency as all array-indexing was already zero-based (as are all arrays in Python). This may take a little getting-used-to, but hopefully will avoid confusion in the future. A second significant enhancement concerns the ability to specify time-varying boundary conditions that are specified with a sequence of layer-row-column-values, like the WEL and GHB packages. A variety of flexible and readable ways have been implemented to specify these boundary conditions. FloPy is an open-source project and any assistance is welcomed. Please email the development team if you want to contribute.
